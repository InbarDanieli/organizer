# organizer


## Recomended Pages:
### [List Page](https://inbardanieli.github.io/organizer/list/simple_list.html)
- you can add items to your list and mark them when as 	"~~done~~"
- you can add items to a drop down element, and add those items to your list so if you need to add something several times you dont have to write it over again
- you can delete your items in the list and in the drop down if needed, 

> note: this site is just in its begining, but i have a lot of features and improvment that will be added to the page in the future! (-:
